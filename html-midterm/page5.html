    <h1>Page modifications for HTML Midterm</h1>
    <h2>Page 1 Modifications </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Changed the page language to english, writing the line html lang="en" at the beginning of the document. </li>
            <li>Changed the heading of the page to match the source material, named the New Beehive Inn</li>
            <li>Added a closing tag to the table element that was previously missing.</li>
            <li>Added a closing li tag that was missing for item 3.</li>
            <li>Added a closing td tag to cell 3 that was missing.</li>
            <li>Got rid of the opening html element since it was redundant, still have a closing html tag at the end of the document.</li>
            <li>Doing these edits validated page 1 according to the W3 validator.</li>
            <li>Added a link to page 5 in the nav bar to be able to see edits as well as a span element to match the formatting for the other pages.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Page 2 Modifications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Got rid of the bolded element for the h2 "Interior" tag since it did not make sense to have.</li>
            <li>Changed all seperating headings to h2 to make the page look more cohesive and make sense, rather than mixing up h2, h3, h4, etc.</li>
            <li>Added a link to wikipedia for what a segmental arch is, replacing the dud link that was already there.</li>
            <li>Added a link to wikipedia for what an architectural bay is, replacing the broken link prewritten in.</li>
            <li>Changed the hr tag placement to enclose the headings with the corresponding information, seperating the page and making it more readable for the entire page. I kept the original hr tag under the title "New Bradford Inn" because I thought it looked better this way, isolating the intro and leaving the other portions clear from one another. </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Page 3 Modifications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Added !DOCTYPE to the beginning of the page.</li>
            <li>Added language type as english to the top of the page.</li>
            <li>Linked the cars.css stylesheet to the page as well as adding a title and the same meta as page 2 to the top of the page.</li>
            <li>Added a link to page 5 in the nav bar.</li>
            <li>Needed to move the footer blue band to below the contact us section, because you cannot enter your name without it. After different attempts at fixing this, I did not see a clear way to do this without touching CSS.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Page 4 Modifications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a doctype and document language to the beginning of the page.</li>
            <li>Added alt attributes to images missing them, which had thrown a bunch of errors in the validator previously.</li>
            <li>Added opening and closing td elements to images in tables missing them.</li>
            <li>Rearranged the images so their contents are in the correct columns.</li>
        </ul>
